# Command-line Inventory Application Project

A prototype for a mini shop that sells organic fruis and vegetables

### Features

-- A user can create a new item.
-- A user can see a list of all the items.
-- A user can see the details of one item.
-- A user can delete an item.
-- A user can update an item.
-- When a user performs an action like creating or deleting an item, the data file is updated correctly. If the JSON is malformed, there is some logic to prevent writing to the file and thus corrupting the data file.

*working on these *
-- Add a cart function where a user can add items to the shopping cart and see the total price and total number of each item
-- Add a cancel cart function that empties the shopping cart.

### Stretch goals

- Add a new command that lets the user filter by a item property like:
  - a true/false value (see all items that are in stock).
  - a greater than/less than value (see all items under 3 bucks).

- Add unit testing with Jest.
